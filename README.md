# Chatbot-OpenAI

This project is designed for my training and learning about the integration of the OpenAI API within a React-based chat application. The chatbot, powered by OpenAI, is capable of engaging in conversations, providing helpful responses, and showcasing the potential of natural language processing.

## Techs

### Frontend

- React
- Vite (Bundler)
- ESLint (Linter)

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenAI API
- Body-Parser (Middleware para Express)
- CORS (Middleware para Express)

### To run the project:

1. First, in the backend directory, start the server with the command:

   `node index`

2. Then, open a new terminal and in the frontend directory, execute the command:

   `npm run dev start`

### References

This project was built with reference to the tutorial available at FreeCodeCamp.

### Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered changes in the OpenAI API integration since the referenced tutorial. To adapt, I referred to the official OpenAI documentation available at OpenAI Platform Docs. This allowed me to overcome challenges and ensure the seamless functioning of the chatbot.
